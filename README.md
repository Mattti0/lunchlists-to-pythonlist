## Restaurants
There is not much restrictions how to parse list from website or API. 

Good way to start is to make copy of `restaurant.py` and rename that to match your plugin.

Instructions to create new Plugin can be found there also.


This repository should be imported as `restaurants` submodule to make imports work right way and not meant to be used directly

`git submodules add https://github.com/Mattti0/lunchlists-to-pythonlist.git restaurants`
